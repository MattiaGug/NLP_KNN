IMDB1: data downloading, EDA and preprocessing up to the MLP implementation. Due to the fact that google Colab doesn't recognize the pykan library, we had to download the preprocessed data and then work in local.
IMDB2: KAN implementation, once loaded the features in preprocessed_data.csv
preprocessed_data: downloaded data used to perform KAN training.

Analysis of the second dataset (ClinicalReviews dataset):
test.csv, train.csv: the datasets used.
ClinicalReviews: data loading, preprocessing and training of MLP and KAN models
